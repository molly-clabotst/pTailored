            <span class="tm">Puppy Tailrd</span> is the hobby and inegenuity of Connie brought to life.
            Our founder takes measurements and creates whimsical dog sheaths
            for whomever so desires them.<br>
            <br>
            In 2017 Connie's family adopted two sweet, short haired dogs from the south.
            These goofballs didn't know what hit them when they moved into their new
            abode in Minnesota. Connie in her benevolent grace took pity on these
            adorable hunyuks and made them some sweaters. These dogs love their sweaters so
             much that they pout when you take them off.<br>
            <br>
            Connie's love for fiber construction and these dogs love for their new clothes
            inspired her. In January of 2019 she decided to take first steps toward making
             her passion into a business, thus <span class="tm">Puppy Tailrd</span> is born.
